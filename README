This program is designed to provide a web interface to a PC that I am planning on using as a router for my home network. This project is also an excuse for me to learn the Rich Ajax Platform. Some of the things I want to be able to do with it are:

* Download files
* Wake-on-lan any computers on the network
* Provide GUI for proxy software

...and more. Currently, only downloading of HTTP files to a temp directory is implemented. Also, ignore the remnants of the RAP Mail Demo in there, they will be phased out eventually.




Since GPL compatibility with Eclipse plugins is questionable, I'm releasing this under EPL.
